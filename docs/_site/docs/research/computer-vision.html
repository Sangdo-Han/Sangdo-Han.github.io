<h1 id="computer-vision">Computer Vision</h1>

<p>simple definition : <em>Computer Vision is a visionary understanding of computer.</em></p>

<p>With a significant acheivement in Deep Learning Architectures ( CNN, RNN, transformers, GAN, leveraging LLM, Diffusion Models, and so on) with large datasets like ImageNet, there are a significant progress in computer vision.</p>

<p>However, there are still unsolved questions, efficiency, reliability, robustness, linkage to other modalities, temporal evolution of scene in computer vision and understanding the gap between computer vision and human visionary behavior.</p>

<p>As I startd my AI career with computer vision, I will cautiously post the contents and fix the contents regularily.</p>
