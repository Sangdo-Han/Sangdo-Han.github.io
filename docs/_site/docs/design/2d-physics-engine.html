<p>In this design chapter, we will make a simple 2D phyiscs engine… (Maybe 3D in later)
I will display more than 10,000 particles and make those particles be applied in a newtonian fluid dynamcis.</p>

<!-- ## Conclusion

Your plan to design a physics engine in both Python and Rust, followed by integrating the Rust engine with Python, is comprehensive and well-structured. This approach allows you to leverage the strengths of each language while addressing performance and scalability concerns.

By implementing the physics engine in Python first, you gain insights into the design requirements and can validate the functionality with a familiar language and ecosystem. Transitioning to Rust for performance optimization and using Bevy for rendering adds scalability and efficiency to your engine.

Finally, interfacing the Rust engine with Python ensures that you can leverage existing Python codebases and libraries while benefiting from the performance improvements offered by Rust.

Overall, your design approach promises to yield a robust and efficient physics engine suitable for a wide range of applications. -->
