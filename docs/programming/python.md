# Tips for Python

When I think of Python, I feel a sense of irony. Although it's one of the most versatile programming languages, at its core, Python is often used as an "interface language" or a "glue language" to connect to compiled libraries (written in C or C++).

Ironically, it's precisely this "glue" characteristic that has driven Python's popularity across numerous fields, including automation, web backends, and especially machine learning and deep learning.

This section provides useful tips for achieving fast processing and well-designed programming with Python.
