# Python

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of python, I feel somewhat sad because eventhough it is one of the most useful programming language, looking the low-levels of python, python projects are mostly used as an `interface language` or `glue language` to use compiled (C / C++ compiled) libraries... Therefore, when you write a python, you might spend most of time searching for the APIs of libraries instead of writing a sole python code because raw-python is too slow or underperform.
