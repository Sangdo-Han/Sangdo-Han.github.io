# Introduction

Multi-threading, parallel computing, concurrent programming are powerful but quite difficult. 

Eventhough a top-level programmer designs a program, it is always expected that his/her first approach is a `single threaded` or `sequential` program.    

In this sense, we need to study this subject precisely and thoroughly with low-level approach, then capsulize this as possible for not thinking much with high-level approaches.

**Some of explanations and the python examples are originated (but somewhat modified by myself) from famous concurrent programming book - `Grokking Concurrency` (Bhargava, Aditya, and Aditya Y. Bhargava. Grokking algorithms. Simon and Schuster, 2024.)**   


But most of explanations and **all the C++ codes are originated from myself.**
