# Introduction

Multi-threading, parallel computing, concurrent programming are powerful but quite difficult. 

Eventhough a top-level programmer designs a program, it is always expected that his/her first approach is a `single threaded` or `sequential` program.    

In this sense, we need to study this subject precisely and thoroughly with low-level approach, then capsulize this as possible for not thinking much with high-level approaches.
