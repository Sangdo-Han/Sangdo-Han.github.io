# Introduction

Multi-threading, parallel computing, concurrent programming are powerful but quite difficult. 

Eventhough a top-level programmer designs a program, it is always expected that his/her first approach is a `single threaded` program.    

In this sense, we need to study this subject precisely and thoroughly with low-level approach, then capsulize this as possible for not thinking much with high-level approaches.

## Basic Terminology
   


| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| **Process** | A program in execution. It is an instance of a program that is running on a computer. |
| **Thread** | A lightweight process. It is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently of other threads. |
| **Process ID (PID)** | A unique identifier that is assigned to each process. It is used to identify the process and to distinguish it from other processes. |
| **Thread ID (TID)** | A unique identifier that is assigned to each thread. It is used to identify the thread and to distinguish it from other threads. |
| **Parent process** | A process that creates another process. The created process is called the child process. |
| **Child process** | A process that is created by another process. The creating process is called the parent process. |
| **Kernel** | The core of the operating system. It is responsible for managing processes and other resources. |
| **Scheduler** | The scheduler is responsible for scheduling processes to run on the CPU. |
| **Context switching** | The process of switching from one process to another. |
| **Inter-process communication (IPC)** | IPC is the process of communication between processes. |
| **register** | A small, fast memory that is used to store data that is being used by the CPU (for frequent uses)|
| **Program counter** | A register that stores the address of the next instruction that the CPU will execute |
