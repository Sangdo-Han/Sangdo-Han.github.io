# Shared-Memory IPC

Shared-memory IPC allows multiple tasks to access a common memory segment. This technique is fast because there is no need to copy data between tasks, but it requires proper synchronization mechanisms like semaphores or mutexes to ensure data consistency.

### Shared Memory

Shared memory is a region of memory that can be accessed by multiple processes. It enables high-speed data exchange but requires explicit synchronization to prevent data corruption or race conditions.

### Thread Pool Pattern

A thread pool consists of multiple worker threads that execute tasks concurrently. These threads share resources, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads frequently. Synchronization techniques, such as mutexes and condition variables, help manage access to shared resources efficiently.
