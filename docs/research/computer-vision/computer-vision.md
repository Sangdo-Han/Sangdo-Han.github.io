# Computer Vision

simple definition : *Computer Vision is a visionary understanding of computer.*    
   

With a significant acheivement in Deep Learning Architectures ( CNN, RNN, transformers, GAN, leveraging LLM, Diffusion Models, and so on) with large datasets like ImageNet, there are a significant progress in computer vision.
     

However, there are still unsolved questions, efficiency, reliability, robustness, linkage to other modalities, temporal evolution of scene in computer vision and understanding the gap between computer vision and human visionary behavior.   

As I startd my AI career with computer vision, I will cautiously post the contents and fix the contents regularily.
