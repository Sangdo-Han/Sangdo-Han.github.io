# Controls and Robotics  

Based on the books [Sontag's mathematical control theory](http://www.sontaglab.org/FTPDIR/sontag_mathematical_control_theory_springer98.pdf),
[Thrun's probabilistic robotics](https://docs.ufpr.br/~danielsantos/ProbabilisticRobotics.pdf) and lecture notes which I've took in University of Michigan.
