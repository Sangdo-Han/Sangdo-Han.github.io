# 2D Physics Engine

In this design chapter, we will make a simple 2D phyiscs engine... (Maybe 3D in later)
I will display more than 10,000 particles and make those particles be applied in a newtonian fluid dynamcis.

## TO-DO list

1. Rough design with python.
2. Increase performance with rust programming.
3. Make rust compiled engine be interfaced to python. 

### 1. Rough Design with Python

**Approach**:
- Implement a basic 2D particle physics engine in Python.
- Visualize the particles using the Pygame library.
- Simulate Newtonian fluid dynamics for the particles.

**Tasks**:
1. Define Particle class with position, velocity, mass, and methods for applying forces and updating position.
2. Implement a Particle System class to manage multiple particles.
3. Use Pygame for visualization and user interaction.

### 2. Increase Performance with Rust Programming

**Approach**:
- Rewrite the physics engine and visualization components in Rust.
- Leverage Rust's performance benefits for large-scale simulations.
- Utilize the Bevy game engine for rendering and simulation.

**Tasks**:
1. Translate the Particle and Particle System logic to Rust.
2. Implement Newtonian fluid dynamics in Rust.
3. Utilize Bevy for rendering and simulation management.

### 3. Interface Rust Compiled Engine to Python

**Approach**:
- Create a bridge between Python and Rust for seamless integration.
- Use FFI (Foreign Function Interface) or other inter-process communication mechanisms.
- Enable Python scripts to interact with the compiled Rust engine.

**Tasks**:
1. Expose Rust functions as a library callable from Python.
2. Handle data exchange between Python and Rust for particle state and simulation parameters.
3. Ensure compatibility and performance between Python and Rust components.


<!-- ## Conclusion

Your plan to design a physics engine in both Python and Rust, followed by integrating the Rust engine with Python, is comprehensive and well-structured. This approach allows you to leverage the strengths of each language while addressing performance and scalability concerns.

By implementing the physics engine in Python first, you gain insights into the design requirements and can validate the functionality with a familiar language and ecosystem. Transitioning to Rust for performance optimization and using Bevy for rendering adds scalability and efficiency to your engine.

Finally, interfacing the Rust engine with Python ensures that you can leverage existing Python codebases and libraries while benefiting from the performance improvements offered by Rust.

Overall, your design approach promises to yield a robust and efficient physics engine suitable for a wide range of applications. -->
