Note : Macro Macros are expanded at compile time, so that the actual generated codes will replace the macro before the program is executed. When you want to use macro to generate code in compile level, you need to put ! right after the name of macro. You can also make your codes be a macro. However, there is no free lunch. Macro makes you comfortable in writing a program or save execution time (by avoiding function call) but your compile time might also increase as much you use macro.

Enums . Enums, which stands for enumerations, is one of the powerful custom type that enables to make custom types in modern programming language. Briefly speaking, enums gives user to selecting a value of a possible set of values. With this concept, users can write more safe and expressive codes. enum OrderStatus{ Pending, Approved, Processing, Shipped, Delievered, Canceled, } struct Order{ id: u32, customer_name: String, items: Vec&lt;String&gt;, status: OrderStatus, } fn main(){ let mut order = Order{ id:1, customer_name: \"Sangdo Han\".to_string(), items: vec![\"TV\".to_string(), \"Laptop\".to_string()], status:OrderStatus::Pending, }; order.status = OrderStatus::Processing; } .

    "content": "So far, we construct functions, enums and structs with strong type signatures or members. However, sometimes these strict way may induce duplications. For instance, let us define a function that give result of addtion of two numbers. fn add(a:f64, b:f64)-&gt;f64{ a+b } fn main(){ let a32:f32 = 3.0; let b32:f32 = 5.0; println!(\"{}\", add(a32,b32)); // we have error cuz we defined function `add` only with `f64`, not `f32` } . The above code causes compiler error. This is because the function can only takes f64. Even if we know that addition works with the same way with i32 or f32, as we only defined add function only works for f64, the code has issues. To solve this problem we might need more add functions respect to each type. However this approach could result in redundancies in your code and it makes hard for you (or your team) to maintain the code. One of the idea to solve these redundant-prone coding is using generics. With generics, we can set a generic defintion of a function that can handles multiple types as followings: . fn add&lt;T: std::ops::Add&lt;Output= T&gt;&gt; (a :T, b : T ) -&gt; T { a + b } fn main(){ let a32:f32 = 3.0; let b32:f32 = 5.0; println!(\"{}\", add(a32,b32)); let a64:f64 = 4.0; let b64:f64 = 53.0; println!(\"{}\", add(a64, b64)); } . Here, we set T as a abstract type, by putting angle bracket &lt; &gt; right next to the name of function. In this example, since we use standard add operator + we need to say that T has a special trait (or a constraint or characteristic) that this generic type T uses standard add operator’s output. However, if we don’t have those constraints (in this case, use of add-operator), The code snippet would be compiled. The trait std::ops::Add&lt;Output=T&gt; is a powerful concept in Rust. Traits define functionality that types can implement. In this case, std::ops::Add&lt;Output=T&gt; constraint guarantees type T can be properly added within the function. One of the interesting thing is that rust’s generics don’t impact performance. The compiler generates specific code for each type at compile time, ensuring efficiency, resulting in performance equivalent to writing separate functions for each type. Sometimes, we assume that the generalized members / signatures would not always be the same types. In this case, the generic type placeholder needs to be distinguished as followings: . struct Point &lt;T,U&gt;{ x:T, y:U } fn main(){ let x: i32 = 5; let y: f64 = 3.0; let pointxy = Point{x,y}; } .

Raw pointers in Rust are necessary for certain tasks where you need to interact with low-level code, such as interfacing with C libraries, implementing low-level data structures, or performing certain operations that can’t be expressed safely within Rust’s safe abstraction. Here are some scenarios where raw pointers are useful: . | Interfacing with C Code: Rust often needs to interact with C libraries, which typically use raw pointers extensively. Rust’s FFI (Foreign Function Interface) allows you to call functions from C libraries and vice versa, and raw pointers are often used to pass data between Rust and C code. | Unsafe Operations: Some operations inherently require unsafe behavior, such as dereferencing a pointer to arbitrary memory or performing low-level memory manipulation. While these operations should be avoided whenever possible, there are situations where they’re necessary for performance reasons or to implement certain algorithms. | Unsafe Abstractions: Sometimes, you may need to implement your own safe abstractions that rely on unsafe operations internally. While the interface exposed to the user remains safe, the implementation may use raw pointers or other unsafe constructs to achieve certain behaviors efficiently. | Low-Level Data Structures: Implementing low-level data structures like linked lists, trees, or graphs may require direct manipulation of memory addresses, which is facilitated by raw pointers. While Rust’s standard library provides safe abstractions for common data structures, there are cases where custom implementations are necessary or desirable. | Embedded Systems and Systems Programming: In systems programming and embedded systems development, you often need precise control over memory layout and low-level hardware interactions. Raw pointers allow you to express such operations safely within the context of an unsafe block. | . It’s important to note that while raw pointers are a powerful tool, they come with significant responsibility. Rust’s safety guarantees are designed to prevent common programming errors and security vulnerabilities, and bypassing these guarantees with raw pointers can introduce bugs, crashes, or security vulnerabilities if used incorrectly. fn main() { let x = 42; // Reference to x let reference = &amp;x; println!(\"Reference: {}\", reference); // Raw pointer to x let raw_ptr: *const i32 = &amp;x as *const i32; unsafe { println!(\"Raw pointer: {}\", *raw_ptr); } } .

    "content": "Smart pointers in Rust are data structures that not only hold a value but also contain metadata and provide additional functionality beyond what regular pointers offer. They enforce various safety guarantees at compile time, ensuring memory safety and preventing common programming errors. One of the most commonly used smart pointers in Rust is Box&lt;T&gt;. It allows you to allocate values on the heap rather than the stack and provides ownership semantics like any other value in Rust. Here’s a brief overview of Box&lt;T&gt;: . | Box&lt;T&gt;: Box is a smart pointer that owns the data it points to and is stored on the heap (if you’re C++ programmer it resembles unique_ptr but not nullable.). It’s used when you need to have a value with a known size at compile time but don’t know the precise size until runtime, or when you want to transfer ownership of a value across scopes or threads. | . Here’s a simple example of Box&lt;T&gt;: . fn main() { let x = Box::new(42); // Allocate an integer on the heap println!(\"Value: {}\", x); // Print the value stored in the Box } . In addition to Box&lt;T&gt;, Rust provides other smart pointers like Rc&lt;T&gt; and Arc&lt;T&gt; for shared ownership (shared_ptr in C++), Cell&lt;T&gt; and RefCell&lt;T&gt; for interior mutability, and Mutex&lt;T&gt; and RwLock&lt;T&gt; for synchronization, among others. Each smart pointer type has its own characteristics and use cases, allowing you to choose the appropriate one based on your requirements. Smart pointers enable you to write safer, more expressive code by encapsulating complex memory management logic and providing clear ownership semantics. ",

The output of the above code might be scrambled, demonstrating a race condition. Because std::cout is a shared resource, multiple threads trying to write to it simultaneously can interleave their output. This is a classic example of why proper synchronization is essential. Note - Race condition A race condition occurs in concurrent programming when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events, such as the order in which threads or processes are scheduled to run. This can lead to unpredictable and erroneous results because the outcome depends on the interleaving of operations performed by multiple threads or processes.

The OS establishes a communication channel and provides proper system calls for tasks to pass messages through this channel. The advantage of Message-Passing is that the OS manages the channel, providing a useful interface to send and receive data without conflict. However, there is a huge communication cost.

It is true that understanding the basics of photogrammetry is very important to understand deep-learning based 3D reconstruction because deep-learning based methods are built on top of these photogrammetry techniques. In this post, however, it is assumed that the readers have knowledge about deep learning models rather than 3D reconstructions.

    "content": "The paper[1] briefly explains 3 commonly used metric used: MSE, Voxel IoU and cross-entropy. I think the reader might familiar with MSE and cross-entropy. Therefore, I will skip their details. Voxel IoU . In many cases in Computer Vision, IoU represents an abbreviation of Intersection over Union. As you might guess. Voxel IoU is mere volumetric extension of 2D-pixel-IoU. which is: . \\[{IoU={G \\cap P \\over G \\cup P}}\\] Here, G stands for a set of voxels in a ground truth, while P stands for a set of voxels in prediction/reconstruction. This metric is also widely used for 3D object detection or segmentation. Also, for point cloud and mesh representation, sevaral distance metrics between groundtruth and reconstruction can be used as metric. I beleive that readers are familiar with Euclidean Distance, I will post about Chamfer Distance and EMD instead. Chamfer Distance . Chamfer Distance is average of the summation of closest point pairs. \\[Chamfer(G,P) = {1\\over{n}}(\\sum_i \\min_j(||g_i - p_j||) + \\sum_j \\min_i(||g_i - p_j||))\\] More precisely, The formula represents average of distance from each point in one point cloud to its closest point in the other point cloud. and vice versa. EMD . Earth mover’s distance (EMD), also known as the Wasserstein distance, stands for the distance between probability distributions over a region in statistics. \\[EMD(P, \\hat{P})=\\min_{\\phi:P\\rightarrow\\hat{P}} \\sum_{p_i\\in P}||p_i - \\phi(p_i)||\\] This can be computed using the Hungarian Algorithm or Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm.

    "content": "The original survey [1] divides the reconstruction techniques into two main categories by the number of sources. (Reconstruction based on single image or multiple images.) After that, it lists up middle categories with way of representations or how outcome look like with a short descriptions. These could be very helpful for the researchers who are familiar with 3D Computer Vision. However, for the newcomers (I assume that most of readers of survey papers are newcomers), I think that it would be more effective writing if it explains the ways of representing 3D object first, and then explains the models and results. Voxel Representation . Voxel is a volumetric representation which can be comparing to pixel representation in 2D images. Actually, by adding depth (D) into pixel, Voxel achieves representation of 3D. \\(pixel : H \\times W \\times C\\) \\(voxel : H \\times W \\times D \\times C\\) \\(, where \\ H : height , \\ W : width, \\ D : depth, \\ C : channel \\ (color)\\) . Point Cloud Representation . Point Cloud is another way to represent 3D object. A single point cloud is a collection of 3D points (mostly a collection of Cartesian coordinate positions) : . point_cloud = [ [x1, y1, z1], [x2, y2, z2], ... [xN, yN, zN] ] . Mesh Representation . Mesh representation could be another option. Mesh is a collection of base geometry to represent surface. Since the least number of points to construct a surface is 3 (triangle), triangle is widely used for mesh representations: . mesh_representation = [ [point_1, point_2, point_3], [point_4, point_5, point_6], ... [point_a, point_b, point_c] ] . Each point (vertex) represents 3d point (x,y,z) . Other Representation . Implicit Surface . Implicit Surface is a model based surface representation. Models can be a continuous decision boundary of deeplearning network classifiers, suggested in OccNet6, or multi-layer network architecture to extract geometry features and represents 3D shapes in an Euclidean preserving latent space as in UCLID-Net7 This concept is novel but thinking of the mathematics, we can easily see the concepts: . \\[f_{model}(x,y,z) = 0\\] which resembles our well-known implicit surface: . \\[f(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2+z^2 -1 =0\\] a sphere! . depth . About generating depths based on a 2D images, 3D representation also be achieved. ",

The reason why I review this paper is that it gives us a new perspective on LLM, with the glasses of control theory. The main concept of the paper is that analogy on LLM system to control system : LLM be as a plant and the prompt be as a control input. Unlike other ML/DL framework, most of studies on LLM prompting were emperical, without mathematical evidence. This is because that LLM is too huge to understand. The paper, however, tries to understand LLM itself but treat it as a plant to control and give us a concrete understanding. ",

The authors put the Appendix on the paper [1], however, it is better to read Chapter 1-3 of [2]. It is online free.   Briefly speaking, control theory depicts a system whether it is reachable (observable, controllable) and find out how to observe the system’s state and control the system with external inputs (force, current and so on.) .   In mathematically, system is the set of state of plant, time, control input. and transition of state. If we have output space (observable output), we could add output and readout map to the original system. In addition to the appendix [1], .   A system (\\(\\Sigma\\)) consists of: . | State (\\(X\\)): The state of a plant refers to the minimal set of variables that completely define its behavior at any given time. These variables capture the internal condition of the plant. | Control Input (\\(U\\)): Control inputs are the external influences applied to the plant to manipulate its behavior. | Time (\\(T\\)): Time set, the ordered set of positive values. | Transition map (\\(\\phi: X \\times U \\times T^{2} \\rightarrow X\\)): Transition map takes a current state (X(t)) at time t and a control input (u(t)) at time t, and returns the next state (X(t+1)) at the next time step (t+1). Note: \\(T\\) or \\(T^2\\)? If the control varies in time like as in feedback control or time-varying control strategy, we could add additional time space to describe the transition map. In the paper, however, as the transitted time t’ differs from the original t, it seems that author put the additional time space into the collection. I suppose that the authors want to describe t’ and t are nomially different. | Output (\\(Y\\)): Observed output space. | Readout map (\\(h: X \\times U \\times T \\rightarrow Y\\)): Readout map takes a current state (X(t)) at time t and a control input (u(t)) at the time t, and returns the observed(read out) value (Y(t)). | .

The following diagram is an architecture of LLM service with RAG, drawn by myself, which could be a little bit different from the original paper[1]. In batch process, we can save our constarints (contexts, documents or policies) with embedding models, (vectorization / encoding / graph embedding and so on). Once we have a language query from user, we simply encode the query with the same embedding models, and findout the document near the vector. Finally, we simply put found documents and original user’s query to LLM, we can get generated output with our intended contexts. ",
